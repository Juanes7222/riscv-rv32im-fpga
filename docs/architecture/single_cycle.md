# Single-Cycle RV32IM Microarchitecture

**File:** `rtl/single_cycle/top_single_cycle.sv`  
**ISA:** RV32IM (base RV32I + M extension)  
**Memory:** Harvard (separate instruction and data memories, see [ADR 001](../decisions/001_harvard_memory_architecture.md))  
**Nominal CPI:** 1 for all RV32I instructions and MUL/MULH/MULHSU/MULHU  
**Effective CPI for division:** 34 for DIV/DIVU/REM/REMU (1 issue cycle + 33 stall cycles, see [ADR 008](../decisions/008_m_extension_implementation.md))

This document is the design reference for Objective 1, Activity 1.1 of the
thesis. It defines the top-level interface, the complete internal signal
inventory, the datapath for each instruction class, and the critical path
relevant to Fmax measurement.

> **Reference:** `docs/architecture/control_signals.md` contains the complete
> per-instruction control signal truth table. This document describes the
> structural and behavioral design; the control signal table is maintained
> separately to avoid duplication.

## Top-Level Interface

The chip boundary is minimal. Memories are synthesized into FPGA fabric and are
not exposed as ports.

```systemverilog
module top_single_cycle (
    input  logic clk,    // 50 MHz oscillator from DE1-SoC (PIN_AF14)
    input  logic rst_n   // Active-low synchronous reset — connected to KEY[0]
);
```

All internal signals are declared as `logic` inside the module body.
Reset vector: `32'h0000_0000` (see [ADR 012](../decisions/012_reset_vector.md)).

### Note on alu_rv32im sequential behavior

`alu_rv32im` is placed in `rtl/shared/` and is used without modification by
both microarchitectures. Although the module contains a sequential state
machine (the radix-2 restoring divisor, see [ADR 008](../decisions/008_m_extension_implementation.md)),
this does not compromise the single-cycle character of the processor for the
following reasons:

1. **All RV32I instructions and MUL/MULH/MULHSU/MULHU complete in one cycle.**
   For these instructions, `div_busy` is permanently de-asserted and the ALU
   behaves as a pure combinational block. The sequential divisor state machine
   remains in `IDLE` and does not affect the datapath.

2. **DIV/DIVU/REM/REMU are the only instructions that activate the divisor.**
   When one of these instructions is issued, the processor stalls for exactly
   32 cycles via `div_busy`. During stall cycles the PC does not advance and
   no instruction retires. This is a deliberate design choice (ADR 008) to
   avoid a fully combinational divisor that would collapse Fmax below the
   value attributable to the load instruction critical path, which would
   invalidate the architectural comparison.

3. **A fully combinational divisor is not a valid design option** for this
   project because it would make measured Fmax a function of divider depth
   rather than of the IF→ID→EX→MEM→WB datapath, undermining the experimental
   validity of the pipeline vs. single-cycle comparison.

The single-cycle label in this project refers to the execution model for the
RV32I base instruction set: each base instruction completes in exactly one
clock cycle with CPI = 1. The M-extension division instructions are documented
as exceptions with CPI = 33.

## Sequential Elements

The processor contains exactly three types of sequential elements:

| Element | Module | Type | Width |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| Program counter | `pc_unit` | Register (FF) | 32 bits |
| Register file | `register_file` | Register array (FF) | 32 × 32 bits |
| Instruction memory | `instruction_memory` | ROM (M10K) | IMEM_DEPTH × 32 bits |
| Data memory | `data_memory` | RAM (M10K) | DMEM_DEPTH × 32 bits |
| Divisor state machine | `alu_rv32im` | FSM + registers | ~70 bits internal |

The divisor FSM is the only sequential element that is not part of the
standard single-cycle datapath. It is dormant for all non-division instructions.

end
```

## Datapath by Instruction Class

### R-type base (ADD, SUB, SLL, SLT, SLTU, XOR, SRL, SRA, OR, AND)

```
alu_a = rs1_data  (alua_src = 00)
alu_b = rs2_data  (alub_src = 0)
alu_res = rs1 OP rs2
next_pc = pc + 4  (branch = 0)
register[rd] = alu_res  (ru_wr = 1, ru_data_wr_src = 00)
div_busy = 0  — result valid this cycle
```

### M-extension multiply (MUL, MULH, MULHSU, MULHU)

```
Same datapath as R-type base.
div_busy = 0  — combinational result, valid this cycle
CPI = 1
```

### M-extension divide (DIV, DIVU, REM, REMU)

```
Same control signals as R-type base.
div_busy = 1 for cycles 1..32 after issue
PC stalls: pc <= pc for 32 cycles
div_busy = 0 on cycle 33: alu_res valid, pc advances
register[rd] = alu_res  (ru_wr = 1)
Effective CPI = 33
Corner cases (div-by-zero, signed overflow) resolved in cycle 1: div_busy = 0 immediately.
```

### I-type ALU (ADDI, SLTI, SLTIU, XORI, ORI, ANDI, SLLI, SRLI, SRAI)

```
alu_a = rs1_data  (alua_src = 00)
alu_b = imm_out   (alub_src = 1, imm_src = 000)
alu_res = rs1 OP imm
register[rd] = alu_res  (ru_wr = 1, ru_data_wr_src = 00)
CPI = 1
```

### LUI

```
alu_a = 32'b0    (alua_src = 10 — constant zero, ADR 005)
alu_b = imm_out  (U-type: {imm[31:12], 12'b0})
alu_res = 0 + imm_out = imm_out
register[rd] = alu_res  (ru_wr = 1)
CPI = 1
```

### AUIPC

```
alu_a = pc       (alua_src = 01)
alu_b = imm_out  (U-type)
alu_res = pc + imm_out
register[rd] = alu_res  (ru_wr = 1)
CPI = 1
```

### JAL

```
alu_a = pc       (alua_src = 01)
alu_b = imm_out  (J-type signed offset)
alu_res = pc + J_offset  (jump target)
branch = 1, mask_pc_lsb = 0
next_pc = alu_res
register[rd] = pc_plus4  (ru_data_wr_src = 10)
CPI = 1
```

### JALR

```
alu_a = rs1_data  (alua_src = 00)
alu_b = imm_out   (I-type signed offset)
alu_res = rs1 + I_offset
branch = 1, mask_pc_lsb = 1
next_pc = {alu_res[31:1], 1'b0}  (LSB forced to zero, ADR 006)
register[rd] = pc_plus4  (ru_data_wr_src = 10)
CPI = 1
```

### Conditional Branch (BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU)

```
alu_a = pc       (alua_src = 01)
alu_b = imm_out  (B-type signed offset)
alu_res = pc + B_offset  (branch target — computed in parallel with condition)
branch_unit evaluates condition on rs1_data / rs2_data directly (ADR 007)
next_pc = branch ? alu_res : pc_plus4
ru_wr = 0, dm_wr = 0
CPI = 1  (no branch penalty in single-cycle: decision and fetch are same cycle)
```

### Load (LB, LH, LW, LBU, LHU)

```
alu_a = rs1_data  (alua_src = 00)
alu_b = imm_out   (I-type byte offset)
alu_res = rs1 + offset  (memory address)
dm_rd_data = data_memory[alu_res]  (dm_wr = 0, dm_ctrl = <size/sign>)
register[rd] = dm_rd_data  (ru_data_wr_src = 01)
CPI = 1
```

### Store (SB, SH, SW)

```
alu_a = rs1_data  (alua_src = 00)
alu_b = imm_out   (S-type split offset)
alu_res = rs1 + offset  (memory address)
data_memory[alu_res] = rs2_data  (dm_wr = 1, dm_ctrl = <size>)
ru_wr = 0
CPI = 1
```

## Critical Path Analysis

The longest combinational path determines Fmax after place-and-route. For
RV32I instructions the critical path is the **load instruction path**:

```
PC register output
  → instruction_memory (combinational read, ADR 011)
  → control_unit (combinational decode on opcode/funct3/funct7)
  → register_file (combinational read on rs1_addr)
  → alu_a_mux
  → alu_rv32im (ADD: combinational adder)
  → data_memory (combinational read)
  → wb_mux
  → register_file setup time
```

For MUL/MULH/MULHSU/MULHU, the DSP-block multiplication path may compete
with the load path. This is determined empirically by the Timing Analyzer
after place-and-route. The actual critical path is reported in
`results/single_cycle/` after the first synthesis replica.

The divisor path does **not** appear on the critical path because it is
implemented as a multi-cycle FSM. Its output is captured in a register and
presented combinationally to `alu_res` only after `div_busy` de-asserts.

## Memory Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `IMEM_DEPTH` | 16384 words | 64 KB — fits CoreMark + riscv-tests (ADR 013) |
| `DMEM_DEPTH` | 8192 words | 32 KB — fits CoreMark data + stack (ADR 013) |
| Reset vector | `0x00000000` | First word of instruction memory (ADR 012) |

## Known Limitations and Explicit Exceptions

1. **CPI = 1 only for RV32I and M-extension multiply.**
   DIV/DIVU/REM/REMU have effective CPI = 33 due to the 32-cycle radix-2
   restoring divisor (ADR 008). Division corner cases (division by zero,
   signed overflow) are handled in 1 cycle with CPI = 1.
   This must be reported explicitly in the experimental results section.

2. **No branch penalty.** The processor has no speculative execution. The
   branch decision and the fetch of the next instruction occur in the same
   cycle. There are no flush cycles for branches in the single-cycle design.

3. **No exception or interrupt handling.** `ecall`, `ebreak`, and all CSR
   instructions are treated as no-ops (default case in control unit:
   `ru_wr = 0`, `dm_wr = 0`, `branch = 0`). riscv-tests pass/fail detection
   uses the `tohost` memory write convention, not `ecall` execution.

4. **No memory-mapped I/O.** Both memories are plain RAM/ROM with no
   address decoding for peripheral registers.
